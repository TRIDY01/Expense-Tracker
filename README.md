**💸 Console Expense Tracker (in C#)**

Ever get to the end of the month and wonder where all your money went? 🤔 Me too.
That's why I built this simple expense tracker using C#. It's a straightforward, no-frills console app to help you log your spending and see where your cash is actually going. All your info is saved locally in a JSON file, so your data stays right there on your machine.

**✨ What can it do?**

➕ Log Expenses on the Fly: Quickly jot down what you spent, including the date, category (like 'Food' or 'Transport'), a quick note, and the amount.
👀 See Your History: Pull up a clean list of all your past expenses whenever you need a look back.
🧮 Get the Big Picture: Instantly calculate your total spending so far.
💾 Your Data is Safe: The app automatically saves and loads your data from expense_data.json, so you can close it and pick up right where you left off.

**🛠️ Getting Started**
